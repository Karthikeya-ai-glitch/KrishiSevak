Our solution directly empowers Indian farmers with instant, actionable agricultural intelligence that addresses their daily decision-making process. This will help them make their own informed decisions without having to rely on any other person or organisation.
Farmer-centric decision support - Context-aware advice to farmers for any queries related to crop type, crop disease and their preventive measures, market fertilizer prices, government schemes and local climate.

Localized language support - Handles multiple language support in terms of speech as well as text for better accessibility in the rural parts of India.

Value and Cost optimization - Informs farmers about crop market prices, local fertilizer prices, and government subsidies. Location specific weather forecasts and irrigation schedules will help in optimizing water usage.

Scalable Innovation - Can expand to livestock, fisheries, or agri-supply chain tracking and uses region-specific datasets for accurate advice in each district.
